; Purpose:             Perform the following calculation: $25 + $37 - $15
;

; Labels (symbols defining a value) are always places in column 1.
    ; Labels are NOT case sensitive
    ; Labels can be followed by an optional colon (:).

; Data.
        org        $1000       ; Set the current location to the starts of RAM.
p:      db         $25         ; First addend is at location p.                 (memory address $1001)
q:      db         $37         ; Second addend is at location q.                (memory address $1002)
r:      ds         1           ; Sum will be stored at location r.              (memory address $1003)

; Code.
        org        $2000       ; Set the current location to the start of ROM.
        ldaa       p           ; Load value of p into accumulator a.
        adda       q           ; Add the value in accumulator a to the value of q.
        deca                   ; Decrement accumulator a.
        staa       r           ; Store a in memory location r.
        end                    ; End program.
